The Browser Use Cloud API pricing consists of two components:

1. **Task Initialization Cost**: $0.01 per started task
2. **Task Step Cost**: Additional cost based on the specific model used for each step

## LLM Model Step Pricing

> **Limited Time Offer**: O3 model pricing reduced from $0.03 to $0.01 per step!

The following table shows the total cost per step for each available LLM model:

| Model                            | Cost per Step |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| GPT-4.1                          | $0.025        |
| GPT-4.1 mini                     | $0.0075       |
| O4 mini                          | $0.02         |

## Example Cost Calculations

**Using GPT-4.1 for a 10 step task:**
- Task initialization: $0.01
- 10 steps × $0.025 per step = $0.25
- **Total cost: $0.26**

**Using O3 for a 10 step task (Limited Time Offer):**
- Task initialization: $0.01
- 10 steps × $0.01 per step = $0.10
- **Total cost: $0.11**
